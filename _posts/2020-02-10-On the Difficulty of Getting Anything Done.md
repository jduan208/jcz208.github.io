# On the Difficulty of Getting Anything Done

I now understand why humans search for local maxima in trading off effort and effective output, why the inefficient bureaucracies I hated so much as a high schooler, and still hate, are the way they are, and why the world is less than a fraction of a percent of what it could be. 

It's not like I've never known that working hard and caring a lot was, by definition, *hard*. It's just that I've only recently been able to stare this obvious truth in the face, unblinking as I let it pass over my flaws and judge me for what I have not done. 

In the story that I tell myself about myself, I consciously think that I really, deeply care about the long-term future of humanity. I'm trying to dedicate my life to working on AI safety, so that has to count for something, right? I'm starting an EA group at UConn, so that's going to have some sort of non-negligible impact, right? 

And yet, these sorts of thoughts only occupy maybe 3 hours a week, maximum. The other however many hours are filled with media consumption, with aimless reading, with walking around and thinking about nothing, with constantly worrying that the thing I'm doing isn't as important or urgent as another thing, starting the other thing, then worrying about that too. It's impossible to reach an ideal, but I've started to notice more and more frequently, in those ever-fleeting moments of clarity, that I'm not even 1% of what I think I am.

I tell myself that I'm more of a theory person, so I don't have to deal with actually getting my hands dirty and doing something that could be imperfect, that could take up more time than I anticipate, that could end up being more than zero but less than 100%. I tell myself that I'm an effective altruist, so I get a pass to ignore other, "less-optimal" issues, even though I'm not doing anything for the optimal issues either. I tell myself that I've got too much going on to take on other stuff, and then I go back to my dorm and sit around and eat another package of family sized Oreos.

I've come to the realization that [I am Bruce](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108093932/http://starcitygames.com/magic/misc/2005_Stuck_In_The_Middle_With_Bruce.html). 

I recently emailed maybe 30-40 people working in the AI safety field about their thoughts on my project, and I got a few responses. My family didn't really do Christmases growing up, but I'd imagine that feeling is the same feeling I got when some of them—some of the people I look up to, whose thoughts I consume, whose work I idolize—responded to me. However, their responses only make me feel more small, more insignificant, more incapable of doing anything of real-world substance. 

When I emailed them back, I could feel myself bullshitting everything I said, looking things up that I'd never heard of before and trying to pass what I spewed off as things I'd already thought about. I got some emails back pointing me towards things I should read, but I can already tell that 90% of those words and ideas I'll never see. My past track record with emailing people for advice on starting the EA group has shown me that. 

It's a delicate balance, trying to maneuver between being honest with myself and trying not to discourage myself before I even try. Obviously, I'm failing at that. 

I'm not sure what the actual core content of this post is. I suppose it's my way of feeling like I'm creating at least something, even if it isn't contributing anything to the world at large. A temporary balm for my ego, placating it before it turns inwards again. 

A thought I've been kicking around in my head for a while, but have never been able to formalize out loud, is that all of this potential that I'm pretty sure I have will go to waste, that it'll never come up or create or do or think of or produce anything of genuine, original, net-beneficial value. That I'll just tell myself stories until I die, and that'll be it. That feeling of hopelessness, of fundamental impotence, of pure and utter uselessness, is what feel most often in what I classify as nightmares.

Hopefully no one I know ever sees this post.
