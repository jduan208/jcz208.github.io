# SparkNotes: Jeffrey Duan 

### Who are you?
Hey there! My name's Jeffrey Duan, and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Connecticut. Right now, I'm interested in encoding human values as formal systems such that intelligent agents will be able to follow along and adhere to our collective values, but that may very well change. 

To that end, I'm currently trying to create an "interpretable" intelligent agent that can output its internal model of the world and of my preferences as something I can understand.

Other than that, I'm starting an Effective Altruism group at UConn, so look out for that.

### Why should I care?
I figure the sorts of ideas I've been lucky enough to have been exposed to are vitally important to the long term survival and flourishing of the human race. I'm nowhere near good enough to contribute anything extraordinary quite yet, but I can try to point others who are smarter, harder working, or more focused than I am (hopefully, you) to those sorts of ideas and the people who have exposed *me* to those ideas. Thus, this blog, or alternatively a collection of ~~stolen~~ borrowed ideas.

If any of these ideas interest you or you'd just like to chat, drop me an email at duanjeffrey@gmail.com!
